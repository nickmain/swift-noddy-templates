The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    `for a in foo {
    Hey diddle diddle the \(a) and the fiddle
    and the dish ran away with the spoon
    `}

Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town,
Up stairs and down stairs in his night-gown,
Tapping at the window, crying at the lock,
Are the children in their bed, for it's past ten o'clock?
